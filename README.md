# Minesweeper with Love2d

### Function realized 

You can choose to play minesweeper among simple(9x9,10 bombs), medium(16x16, 40 bombs) and expert(30x16, 99 bombs),which are the same as the three levels of the Microsoft Minesweeper. 

Click the left key to reveal the block and its adjacent ones following traditional minesweeper rules.

Click the right key to flag or dis-flag a block.

When you win, there will be a picture 'win' on the screen and when you lose, the bombs you discovered(flagged) and the bombs you failed to do so will show up differently using different sprites. 

### Function worked on

When finishing a game, restart the game with the same/different maps, or go back to the menu without existing the program.

Add a stage of question (suspicious but not sure) between the flag and dis-flag.  

You can choose to custom your width,height and bomb numbers in a typical range.

Introduce a mechanics to prevent first-click death.

Provide a timer and show how many bombs left unflagged.

Judge the situation as win when player simply flag all the bombs or reveal all the safe grids. (Now you have to do both to be considered as win)
